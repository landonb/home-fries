! On Lenovo ThinkPad: Map Right-Ctrl to Delete
!  L-Ctrl|Fn|Win|Alt|--Space--|Alt|Menu|Ctrl|Browse-back|Up-arrow|Broforward
!                                            Left-Arrow|Down-|Right-Arrow
keycode 105 = Delete
! (I wanted to use browser back button (whose icon looks like a page left,
! and which sits amongst the arrow keys), but either I got the keycode wrong
! or it just doesn't map.
! NOTE: The browser keys are called XF86Back and XF86Forward by `xev`, except
!       when you run xev and press browser back, nothing happens.
! This used to work, maybe on Fedora 14, but now it's Mint 17 and beyond:
!  keycode 166 = Delete
