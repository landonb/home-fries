# Specify a no-op infuse action so that `mr infuse`:
#
# (a) Display more concise, less distracting messages for each repo.
#
#     E.g., on success (true), `mr` shows:
#
#       mr infuse: /path/to/repo
#
#     but if the action is not defined, `mr` shows the more wordy
#
#       mr infuse: no defined action for git repository /path/to/repo, skipping
#
#     which sorta looks like an error, but then you spend the time to read it
#     and you either realize you can ignore the message, or you think, well,
#     maybe skipping is bad, and I at least want to define a stub to run;
#
#     and
#
# (b) Counts and reports the skipped repos as 'ok' rather than 'skipped'.
