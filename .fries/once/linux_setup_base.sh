# Configuration

# DEVs: Customize these options, maybe. See: custom_setup.template.sh

# The real or fake machine domain (e.g., "fake_domain.tld" works,
# it'll just mask anything of the real name out there in the net).
# Note: In the m4 templates, USE_DOMAIN is MACH_DOMAIN.
#USE_DOMAIN="localhost"
# FIXME: Prompt for the domain if not specified in config wrapper?
#        Or can we just use hostname's response?
#        What is hostname's response on a fresh install?
USE_DOMAIN=$(hostname --domain)
if [[ -z ${USE_DOMAIN+x} ]]; then
  USE_DOMAIN="home.fries"
fi

# If you're dual-booted or if you've configured a VirtualBox Shared Folder,
# you can set the device name here and the script will mount it for you.
# E.g., for VirtualBox,
#  USE_MOUNTPT="C_DRIVE"
#  DST_MOUNTPT="/win"
# or for a dual-boot,
#  USE_MOUNTPT="/dev/sda2"
#  DST_MOUNTPT="/fsm"
# Otherwise, just leave it blank.
USE_MOUNTPT=""
DST_MOUNTPT=""

# A few common project group name config options.

# Specify groups to create. The current user will be added to
# these groups, as will postgres and the www-data/apache user.
# This is so you can setup a shared development environment.
# DEVs: Add to this array in custom_linux.sh. Each group is
# generally the name of a different project that uses different
# resources that you want postgres and apache to be able to access,
# per the specifics of whatever projects on which you're working.
# I.e., you want to make htdocs files group-readable, and not
# necessarily world-readable, and you want distinct linux users
# to all be part of the same development group. This is generally
# only necessary in a shared work environment and not on a personal
# development machine.
USE_PROJECT_USERGROUPS=()

# Some projects also have their own postgres users.
# MAYBE: Move USE_PROJECT_PSQLGROUPS and USE_PROJECT_USERGROUPS
#        to project-specific setup scripts.
# This setting is probably useful even on a personal development
# machine, as many projects hard-code the name of or use a common
# convention to name the postgres user used to connect to the db.
USE_PROJECT_PSQLGROUPS=()

# An old Cyclopath hack: Change postgres and apache config file
# group ownership so anyone in the Cyclopath group can edit any
# machine's services' config.
# Note: On the U of MN's CP network, you'd want to use the group's
# group name, e.g., `grplens`, but on your own dev machine, using
# the `staff` built-in is just fine, and it makes sense to use.

# We could download tarballs and whatnots to ~/Downloads but so many

# location to store downloaded files and their compiled offsprings.

# the /usr/share/icons/ files and find something you like or add you own.
