# ------------------------------------------
# About

# This script `apt-get install`s a ton of packages,
# it configures Mint and MATE to a particular developer's tastes,
# and it downloads, compiles and installs a few non-apt apps.
#
# If you're familiar with and trust this script, go ahead and
# run it on a fresh Linux installation. If this script is new
# to you, or if you've been incrementally updating the script
# to include software you've installed since last running the
# script, you'll probably want to double-check the tasks down
# below to make sure this script will fulfill all your needs.

# 2015.01.26: I mucked with the script (created all
#             the subscripts) and need to test it.
# 2016.03.23: And away we go. Setting up a keepertrapper.





# FIXME: Move following to the laptop setup script:

# FIXME: Document git'ing home-fries and setting up that way.
# FIXME: Document copying over sync-script file and setting up that way.
# cd ~/Documents/packered_larry_2015_12_30_13h33m45s/home/landonb
# cp -ari * ~
# cp -arn * ~
#         Especially ~/.ssh and cheat/
# FIXME: /kit and /srv/excensus should link from ${HOME}/Documents if home dir is encrypted...
#          look for: ${HOME}/.ecryptfs
#          look in /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt
#                  for home directory path
#          look for mount point: df ${HOME}

# /home/username/.Private 315482376 101351268 198105472  34% /home/username
#
# BEST TO USE
#   ecryptfs-verify --home &> /dev/null
#   and then check $?
#
# Check if swap encrypted:
#
# sudo blkid | grep swap
# and should check for an output similar to
# /dev/mapper/cryptswap1: UUID="95f3d64d-6c46-411f-92f7-867e92991fd0" TYPE="swap" 
#
# sudo cryptsetup status /dev/mapper/cryptswap1
# and check $?
# (to see swap name: swapon -s)
#
# FIXME: laptop not using encrypted swap!
#

# FIXME: Setup .fries, .erectus, etc.
# FIXME: 2016.01.07: Setup ~/.fries/cheat and other missing doodads...
#         need to figure out

# FIXME: See below:
#         Fix /etc/default/grub here for host OS install.
