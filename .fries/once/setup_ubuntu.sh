# About

# This script `apt-get install`s a ton of packages,
# it configures Mint and MATE to a particular developer's tastes,
# and it downloads, compiles and installs a few non-apt apps.
#
# If you're familiar with and trust this script, go ahead and
# run it on a fresh Linux installation. If this script is new
# to you, or if you've been incrementally updating the script
# to include software you've installed since last running the
# script, you'll probably want to double-check the tasks down
# below to make sure this script will fulfill all your needs.

# 2015.01.26: I mucked with the script (created all
#             the subscripts) and need to test it.
# 2016.03.23: And away we go. Setting up a keepertrapper.
# 2016.03.24: It works!

# FIXME/NEXT-TIME: Search for NEXT-TIME for questions to
#                  answer the next time you run this script.

  # 2017-07-19: Aha! I was wondering why this wasn't a problem at home:
  #   on 12.04, there's a checkbox for "Use compositing" that's unchecked,
  #   and Marco and Compwiz are the only two window managers
  #   (so there's no marco-composite and marco-compton).
  # So in 14.04, compositing was added to the window manager option
  #   as a bundled option, in a sense (though not sure what "compton"
  #   means -- is it just non-compositing, or is it something more?).
  #
  gsettings set com.linuxmint.desktop mate-window-manager 'marco-compton'
