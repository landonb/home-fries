# Summary: Helpful `git st`, `git add -p`, and `git diff` wrapper
#          used to hide acceptably deviant repository changes.
# License: GPLv3

# USAGE: This script hides tracked files from a `git status` report that
#        normally differ from the upstream branch's file.
#
#        It can also start a `git diff ...` or `git add -p ...` on those files.
#
#        E.g., if you always enable a certain debug switch after cloning the
#        project, you can use this script to avoid seeing that file always
#        show up in a `git status` or `git diff` command.
#
#        ----   How to ignore files
#        ----    that you need edited
#        ----     in your working directory
#        ----      that you should not commit to you branch
#        ----       because these difference must not be merged to other branches
#        ----        -- especially not production branches! --
#        ----
#        ----   and still be able to have a clean `git status`
#        ----    and be able to `git diff`
#        ----     without always seeing these stupid files
#        ----      and wondering if their diff is your dev change
#        ----       or if it's really something you gotta commit.
#        ----
#
#        Instructions for managing working changes in
#        files that cannot be ignored via .gitignore:
#
#           1. Make a copy of the edited file and assign it a .GTSTOK extension.
#              E.g., /bin/cp -a path/to/orig.file path/to/orig.file.GTSTOK
#
#              Think of the file extension, .GTSTOK, meaning,
#              "GiT STatus, you're OKay ignoring this file if it matches its master"
#
#              - This script will diff the two files -- the original, git-tracked file,
#                and the GTSTOK file -- and this script will exclude the file from the
#                `git status` report if the tracked file matches the approved deviation.
#
#                Otherwise, if the tracked file is dirty but doesn't match the GTSTOK file,
#                this script will add the file to the list of files sent to the git command.
#
#           2. By default, this script spits out a `git status` without GTSTOK distractions.
#              It also echoes a `git diff` command that you can copy and paste to do a diff.
#
#              You can also have it start a `git diff` or `git add -p` on the identified
#              files by setting either the GIT_ST_DIFF or GIT_ST_ADDP environment variable,
#              respectively.
#
#              Example USAGEs:
#
#                 alias git-st='git-st.sh'
#                 alias git-diff='GIT_ST_DIFF=true git-st.sh'
#                 alias git-add='GIT_ST_ADDP=true git-st.sh'
#
#                 # assuming the location of git-st.sh is also part of PATH.

# FIXME: git-st not working on files under a subpath (uncles okay, though).
#        E.g., consider a file at repo/subdir/some_file.GTSTOK, then
#                cd subdir ; git-st
#              doesn't work (because our file path is ../subdir/some_file.GTSTOK,
#                            but the `git status` path is just some_file.GTSTOK.
#              (This works from a cousin subdir, though, e.g.,
#                cd different_dir ; git st
#              works because ../subdir/some_file.GTSTOK is what `git st` says, too.)

  #
  #   - I spent, what, this past hour tonight on this? Or maybe even 90 minutes.
  #     But I didn't want to give up!
  #
  #   - First, a taste of my earlier frustration:
  #
  #      "Well this is frustrating!
  #       2016-02-20: [lb] was hoping to run a custom `git diff` command but all hope is lost:
  #
  #       This works:
  #
  #         DIFFABLES=("path/to/some/file.rst" "path/to/some/module.py")
  #         git diff "${DIFFABLES[@]}"
  #
  #       but this doesn't:
  #
  #         eval "git diff" ${diffables}
  #
  #       because git says:
  #
  #         fatal: ambiguous argument 'path/to/some/file.rst':
  #          unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
  #         Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
  #         'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
  #
  #       but if you add the '--' separator then the diff shows up blank, which is the
  #       same thing that happens if you specify a nonfile, e.g., `git diff -- blahshdh`.
  #
  #       So [lb] wonders if maybe the $diffables string has some gunk in it... but I
  #       tried `RUNME=$(echo "git diff ${DIFFABLES[0]}") ; eval $RUNME` and got the
  #       same failure."
  #
  #   - 2016-05-27: On 2/20, I was right about "some gunk in it", but I didn't triage it right!'
  #     If only I'd known about the `od` command!!
  #
  #         TESTING="git diff ${DIFFABLES[0]}"
  #         echo $TESTING | od -c
