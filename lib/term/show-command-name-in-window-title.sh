#     #       123user@host:/ $
#     #  echo -n "123"
#     # Fails: Shows before PS4, e.g.,
#     #      ]0;echo -en ""user@host:/ $
#     #  echo -en "\033]0;${BASH_COMMAND}\007"
#     # Fails: Prints line before every prompt, e.g.,
#     #     echo "${BASH_COMMAND}" 1>&2
#     #     user@host:/ $
#     #  >&2 echo "${BASH_COMMAND}"

  # MEH: (lb): I'd rather the title not flicker for fast commands,
  # but it's nice to have for long-running commands, like `man foo`
  # and `dob edit`, etc.

  # This overrides the title set in PS4 (which is, e.g., \W\a, which prints
  # the basename of the current directory; but fortunately it only overrides
  # it while the command is running: after the command completes, the \W\a
  # title is restored. This makes for a nice titlebar title that shows the
  # basename of the directory when the prompt is active, but shows the name
  # of the actively running command if there is one, e.g., `man bash`.
