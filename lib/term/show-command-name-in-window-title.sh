# Show the currently running command name in the window titlebar.
# - Even though this special title is often short-lived, just in
#   case it's a long-running process, we'll show the window number
#   like we normally do, so the systemwide foregrounder shortcuts
#   still work.

  # but it's nice to have for long-running commands, like `man foo`
  # and `dob edit`, etc.

  # This overrides the title set in PS4 (which is, e.g., \W\a, which prints
  # the basename of the current directory; but fortunately it only overrides
  # it while the command is running: after the command completes, the \W\a
  # title is restored. This makes for a nice titlebar title that shows the
  # basename of the directory when the prompt is active, but shows the name
  # of the actively running command if there is one, e.g., `man bash`.

# Print the terminal "window number".
#
# - The caller adds this to the terminal window title, to enable a
#   collection of systemwide terminal foregrounder shortcuts
#   (e.g., use <Cmd-4> to front the window that starts with "4. ").
#
# - For iTerm2 keybindings, see the DepoXy project:
#     https://github.com/DepoXy/depoxy#üçØ
#   Possibly at:
#     ~/.depoxy/ambers/home/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/0340-applcn-iterm2-fronter.json
#   - Note that iTerm2 has its own *Shortcut to activate a window* shortcuts
#     (that default to <Cmd-Alt-n>), but these only work when iTerm2 is already
#     the active application. (lb): And I want shortcuts that work from anywhere!
#
# - For Alacritty macOS bindings, see the macOS-skhibidirc project:
#     https://github.com/DepoXy/macOS-skhibidirc#üë§
#
# - For mate-terminal MATE bindings, you could add bindings such as:
#     - name: "'Window ‚Äò1.‚Äô mate-terminal focus'"
#       binding: "'<Mod4>1'"
#       action: "'/usr/bin/env bash -c \\\"wmctrl -a \\'1. \\'\\\"'"
#   using the zoidy_matecocido keybindings manager Ansible role
#   (which automates calling dcong/gsettings to wire the bindings):
#     https://github.com/landonb/zoidy_matecocido
#   but you probably don't want to mess with Ansible unless you're
#   familiar with it. Best just to make custom bindings yourself.

# SAVVY: iTerm2 defines a unique environment for each window that includes
# the window number, tab number, pane number, and window ID (GUID), e.g.,
#   $ echo $ITERM_SESSION_ID
#   w3t0p0:B1CDC558-062B-4830-A5EB-8EF1BBFFAB13
#
# SAVVY: Various ways to suss if it's iTerm:
#   [ "${ITERM_SESSION_ID}" = "w3t0p0:B1CDC558-062B-4830-A5EB-8EF1BBFFAB13" ]  # E.g.
#   [ "${ITERM_PROFILE}" = "My Profile" ]  # User's iTerm2 Profile name, e.g.
#   [ "${LC_TERMINAL}" = "iTerm2" ]
#   [ "${TERM_PROGRAM}" = "iTerm.app" ]
#
# HSTRY: iTerm2 v3.2.x prefixed the window number to the window title,
# e.g., "1. bash-command", but iTerm2 v3.3.x does not, which breaks the
# Karabiner-Elements foregrounder shortcuts. This helps fill in the
# missing functionality from iTerm2 v3.2.x. (See also where Homefries
# recreates ITERM_SESSION_ID so that `ssh <host>` to another Homefries
# shell keeps using the same window number, even on a remote host.)
