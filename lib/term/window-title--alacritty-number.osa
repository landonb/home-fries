# SAVVY: Alacritty is not scriptable.
#
# - E.g., this fails:
#
#     tell application "Alacritty"
#       ...
#         repeat with w in windows
#
#   Indicating:
#
#     .../lib/term/window-title--alacritty-number.osa:369:526:
#       execution error: Alacritty got an error:
#         every window doesn‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúcount‚Äù message. (-1708)
#
# - Fortunately there is an alternative solution:
#
#   "The only way to target a non-scriptable application's windows is via
#    the properties of [application] process objects from the System Events
#    context - not via its application object (only scriptable application
#    objects have windows elements)"
#

# DUNNO/2024-07-23: After testing Hammerspoon for a while tonight,
# this AppleScript stopped detecting the window prefixed "1. "
# (and then any time you opened a new terminal it was numbered 1).
#
# - It appears to do with this alternative tell-Alacritty approach:
#
#     tell application "Alacritty"
#       activate
#     end tell
#
#     tell application "System Events"
#       -- Get the frontmost app's *process* object.
#       set frontAppProcess to first application process whose frontmost is true
#     end tell
#
#     # Tell the *process* to iterate its windows.
#     tell frontAppProcess
#       local numbersList
#       set numbersList to { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
#       ...
#
# - But using 'tell processes whose name is "Alacritty"'
#   instead worked, and included the "missing" windows.

tell application "System Events"
  tell processes whose name is "Alacritty"
    local numbersList
    set numbersList to { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
    repeat with idx from 1 to length of numbersList
      set currNum to item idx of numbersList
      -- MAYBE: Maintain list of windows and remove when matches
      --        so we don't iterate through full list every time
      repeat with w in windows
        tell w
          if NAME of w starts with currNum & ". " then
            set currNum to 0

            exit repeat
          end if
        end tell
      end repeat

      if currNum is not 0
        return currNum
      end if
    end repeat
  end tell
end tell
