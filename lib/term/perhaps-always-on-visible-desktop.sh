    # Because I am unable to figure out how to find the owning window ID...
    # (I tried `xdotool search --pid $PPID`, but it appears all shells have
    # the same parent process, the one and only `mate-terminal`. And the
    # windows are not attached to the child, i.e., ``xdotool search --pid $$`
    # shows nothing (and `wmctrl -l -p` confirms that all terminal windows
    # share the same process ID (of the mate-terminal parent)), it looks like
    # our best bet is to use that special title prefix we set just prior to
    # this code being called (in _hf_set_terminal_prompt).
    #
    # Ug again. I thought the title would be set already, but it's not...

    # ... Ug triple! Other windows also have that name while loading, duh!
