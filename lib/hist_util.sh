  # BEWARE: We're not editing the session's in-memory history, so
  # one can still see unredacted passwords, etc., using either
  # `history -a <file>` or `history -w <file>` (the latter to dump
  # history since the last time it was dumped, or the latter to dump
  # all session history).
  # - We're just scrubbing the file that gets writ to user home.
  # - If you really want to clear session history (what's in memory), try:
  #     `history -c`. (Note that `reset` won't do this.)

  # And then we could hook session exit, and add the
  # session's history to the shared history, e.g.,
  #   history -w
  #   cat $HISTFILE >> .bash_history
  # but I'm not sure the benefit. So I'm sticking with
  # a PROMPT_COMMAND hook just to be sure to clean passwords
  # from the history, but otherwise I'm happy if all history
  # from all sessions just gets dumped and interleaved in one
  # file.

  # 2017-02-20: HISTFILESIZE defaults to 500...

  # HISTIGNORE: A colon-separated list of patterns.
  # - Normal shell pattern matching characters.
  # - `&' matches the previous history line.
  # - The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound
  #   command are not tested, but are added regardless. [Ha ha!]
  # 2017-11-19: From Someone Else's Dotfiles, I'm supposing:
  #  # Ignore some controlling instructions.
  #  export HISTIGNORE="[   ]*:&:bg:fg:exit"
  # 2018-04-07: Ignore commands that start with whitespace:
  #  export HISTIGNORE="[ \t]*"
  # 2018-04-07: Ignore `pass insert` commands:
  #  export HISTIGNORE="pass insert *"
  # 2018-04-07: Ignore all `pass` commands (don't bleed names).
  # Note that we use 2 patterns because latter pattern doesn't not match
  # space, because the '*' is a glob match (1+ chars), and not a reg ex
  # (0+ of chars inside brackets). However! That means "[ \t]*pass *"
  # matches, e.g., " echo pass word". Ug... I guess we'll just do the
  # basic ignore; so be careful to not prepend your `pass` commands with
  # whitespace.
  #  export HISTIGNORE="pass *:[ \t]*pass *"
  # 2018-08-15: Why bother anymore??
  #export HISTIGNORE="pass *"
  # NOTE: HISTIGNORE only matches against first line of command.
  #       So if you have, e.g., a multi-line pass insert command:
  #         echo '<password>
  #         YYYY-MM-DD / https://<domain> / <login> / <password> / <notes>
  #         ' | pass insert -m 'foo/bar'
  #       You gotta do something more sophisticated. E.g., post-process
  #       the history file before it hits your dotfiles repo. See:
  #         ~/.homefries/bin/.bash_history_filter.awk
  #       for more advanced filtering.

  # 2017-11-19: More, please!

  #             So that, e.g., `echo "!X"` works.
  #               $ set -o histexpand

  #               bash: !X: event not found

  #               $ echo "!X"
  #               !X
  #             And I _rarely_ use !n to repeat a history command.
  #             Usually, I just up-arrow.
  #             Recently, I've been Ctrl-R'ing.
  #             But I'm always annoyed when a bang in a paragraph
  #             *confuses* the shell.
