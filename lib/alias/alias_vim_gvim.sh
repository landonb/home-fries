# *** Gvim/gVim

# A few different Home Fries commands that open Vim all use the same
# servername, so that the same instance of GVim is targeted by those
# commands. The name doesn't matter (too much; you'll see it in the
# window title bar), but it should be unique among all windows for
# xdotool to identify it (so on macOS you don't have to worry).
#
# Note that `fs` and `fa` assume that `gvim-open-kindness` will be
# found on PATH. Otherwise we could specify it more completely, e.g.,
# ${HOMEFRIES_BIN:-${HOME}/.homefries/bin}, but I don't see a need.

# The `fs` command is just easy to type, starts with 'f' (for 'file',
# I suppose), and so far it doesn't conflict with anything popular of
# which I know (unlike, say, `fd`). I type `fs` or `fs {file}` (or
# `fs <Alt-.>`) a lot when I want to starting editing in GVim.
fs () {
  # NOTE: The servername appears in the window title bar, so you are
  #       encouraged to personalize it accordingly!
  gvim-open-kindness "${HOMEFRIES_GVIM_PRIMARY:-SAMPI}" "" "" "$@"
}

# The `fa` command exists should you want to open a second instance
# of GVim. (I cannot remember the last time I used this command.)
fa () {
  gvim-open-kindness "${HOMEFRIES_GVIM_ALTERNATE:-ALPHA}" "" "" "$@"
