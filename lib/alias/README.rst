Bash Aliases Hints
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
.. Okay, just one.

Hint: To run the native command and not the alias,
      use a ``\`` prefix, e.g., ::

        \rm

      will call the real ``/bin/rm`` and not the alias.

- Also: While I do like having aliases spread across multiple
        files, when I split what was one file into what's now
        32 files, it increased new session boot from .66 secs.
        to a little of 1. #PROFILING
