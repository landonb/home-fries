# The `stt` and `stf` commands show a one-line report for all your repos
# that indicates if each repo is tidy, or has work to be done.
# - The `stt` variant runs quicker but shows only tidiness.
# - The `stf` variant runs about 5-10x slower but shows remote chores.
#
# You can specify myrepos groups (defined with the mr_exclusive command)
# by appending the group name to any of the commands, e.g., `st foo`.
#
# Note that we really need to use the root directory `/` to report on all
# projects because `mr` excludes any projects not under the -d path,
# regardless of being referenced from a .mrconfig file or not.
# - E.g., if ~/.mrconfig references a path outside user home, such as:
#     $ head -n 2 ~/.mrconfig
#     [/foo/bar]
#   then running `mr` command on user home will exclude that project, e.g.,
#     $ mr -d / ls
#   shows the project, but this would not show the project:
#     $ mr -d ~ ls
#   - Well, not unless /foo/bar was really a symlink to a directory under ${HOME}!
#
# And, yup, two of these are straight-up two-character commands, `st` and `sf`.
# - I use them all the time!

# The `stf` command (alias) shows a fancier, more information-dense one-line
# report for all your repos, indicating not only if each project is tidy or
# not, but what sort of remote branch work might also need to be done. Note
# the fancy report takes 5-10 times as long as a plain, is-it-tidy-or-not
# report.
# - Anecdotally, for the author's 265 repos: plain, non-fancy just ran in
#   ~12 secs, while a fancy report ran in ~78 secs, 6.5 times longer.
# So here's that report as its own cmd, like `st`, but with a little `f`ancy.
#
# `sf` alone shows just local repo's fancy report;
# `sff` alone shows all project fancy report one-liners;
# `sf <>` or `sff <>` shows fancy report on group <>.
sf () {
  [ -n "$1" ] && OMR_MYSTATUS_FANCY=true stt "$@" || git my-merge-status
}

sff () {
  OMR_MYSTATUS_FANCY=true stt "$@"
}

# `st` alone shows just local repo's fancy report;
# `stt` alone shows all repos quick tidiness report;
# `st <>` or `stt <>` shows quick tidiness report on group <>.
st () {
  [ -n "$1" ] && OMR_MYSTATUS_FANCY=false stt "$@" || git my-merge-status
}

# Use `stt` to print the fancy report one-liner for the current repo,
# followed by the porcelain status.
# - Note, if you use github.com/landonb/git-smart, these 3 commands are the same:
#   $ stt                  # github.com:landonb/home-fries
#   $ git st               # github.com:landonb/git-my-merge-status/.gitconfig.example
#   $ git my-merge-status  # github.com:landonb/git-my-merge-status/bin/git-my-serve-status
# - There's also a `git stt` alias (from git-my-merge-status) which (despite
#   its name) is not exactly like this `stt` alias. It shows a column-aligned
#   fancy status like the `st` and `sf` reports show (where the spacing might
#   look a little weird for a single line, when not appearing alongside others).
stt () {
  local exclusive="${1}"
  [ -n "${exclusive}" ] && exclusive="MR_INCLUDE=${exclusive}"
