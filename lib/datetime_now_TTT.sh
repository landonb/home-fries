# 2020-09-16: (lb): A little history:
#
# - 2016-07-12: Added TTT and TTTtt to Dubs Vim, after I realized
#               that I had started typing dates when taking notes.
#               I'm not sure how long I had been manually entering
#               dates, just that I was tired of doing so.
#
# - 2017-02-07: "Took you long enough!" I wrote. Apparently I found
#               it amusing that it took 6 months until I added TTT
#               et al to Homefries.
#
# - 2017-02-27: I added TTTtt here. Who knows why it took 20 days.
#
# - 2020-09-16: I finally noticed that the `tt` in Homefries adds
#               seconds ('%S'), which Dubs Vim does not do. I feel
#               that seeing the seconds is just noise, and it makes
#               the date time harder to comprehend at a glance, e.g.,
#               compare "2020-09-16 12:30:44" vs "2020-09-16 12:30".
#               The latter is much easier to grok at first glance.
#               Seeing the seconds makes my brain do more processing.
#
# - 2020-09-16: Over the years, I've developed these habits:
#               - I use the Dubs Vim TTT and TTTtt aliases all the time.
#               - I use $(TTT) often in shells, but rarely do I $(TTTtt).
#               - I don't use any of the alternatives, like TTT_, etc.

# Optional argument specifies date component separator character.

  local sep="${1:--}"

}
