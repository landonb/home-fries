  #   chruby/auto.sh sets a trap on DEBUG,
  #   and if $BASH_COMMAND != $PROMPT_COMMAND,
  #   it walks up the directory tree looking
  #   for a .ruby-version file on which to chruby.
  # Cmd:
  #   trap '[[ "$BASH_COMMAND" != "$PROMPT_COMMAND" ]] && chruby_auto' DEBUG
  # Ref:
  #   BASH_COMMAND
  #     The  command  currently  being  executed or about to be executed,
  #     unless the shell is executing a command as the result of a trap,
  #     in which case it is the command executing at the time of the trap.
  #   PROMPT_COMMAND
  #     If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each
  #     primary prompt.
  #   DEBUG
  #     Refer to the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin
  #     for details of its effect  on  the  DEBUG  trap.
  #   extdebug
  #     If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
  #     1.     The  -F option to the declare builtin displays the source file name and line number corresponding
  #            to each function name supplied as an argument.
  #     2.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command  is  skipped  and
  #            not executed.
  #     3.     If  the  command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value of 2, and the shell is executing in a sub‚Äê
  #            routine (a shell function or a shell script executed by the . or  source  builtins),  a  call  to
  #            return is simulated.
  #     4.     BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in their descriptions above.
  #     5.     Function tracing is enabled:  command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with (
  #            command ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.
  #     6.     Error tracing is enabled:  command substitution, shell functions, and subshells  invoked  with  (
  #            command ) inherit the ERR trap.
  # So:
  #   Every time you run *any* command, auto.sh
  #   crawls the tree looking for .ruby-version.

  # 2017-05-03: I'm disabling this. Seems redonkulous.
  # You have ``gogo`` command et al to accomplish same.
  # And then you're not spinning up dir every time you
  # run a Bash command. And it's not not that's slow,
  # it's just the principal of the thing, man.
