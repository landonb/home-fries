# 1. First ignore everything so we
#    don't goggle the home directory.

# 2. Next, add things *back* to git scrutiny
#    in the home directory that you care about.
#
#    This will be files in the home directory,
#    and the ~/.fries directory.

# *** Home Fries (includes Bash).

# 3. Finally, add general ignore rules
#    (which will just apply to ~/.fries).

# Pop those tags.
