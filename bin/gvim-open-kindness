# HINT: If calling from Karabiner-Elements on macOS, ensure errors
#       can be reported easily via desktop notifications:
#
#         brew install terminal-notifier
#
#       Otherwise any error will be written to a temp file.
#       You can find the most recent such file thusly:
#
#         ls -rt /tmp | grep 'gvim-open-kindness' | tail -1

# By default, this script uses the same servername when it's called,
# so that files are opened in the same instance of gVim.
# - On Linux (X11), the servername should be unique enough that
#   xdotool can identify the gVim window by its name.
# - On macOS, there's no xdotool, but also MacVim brings itself to
#   front by default, so there's nothing lacking, either.
#
# YOU: The server name appears in the Vim title bar, so, please,
#      personalize it!

# Prepare PATH so this script can call `gvim` without a full path.
#
# When this script is used by a Keyboard Shortcut, only a basic shell
# is initialized, and `gvim` might not be found on the default PATH.
#
# - E.g., when Karabiner-Elements (macOS) calls this script, the PATH
#   is very simple: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin.
#
#   But Home Brew installs MacVim to /usr/local/bin, which is not on
#   PATH by default.
#
# - On MATE (at least this is the PATH that I see; I'm not sure if it's
#   common to include ~/.local/bin), a mate-panel launcher PATH reports:
#     /home/user/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:

# In case of trouble, try notifying user via desktop notification.
#
# Because this script is used in contexts (OS Keyboard Shortcuts)
# where we cannot communicate with the user how we normally might
# (e.g., stdout or stderr), try using a desktop notification.
#
# - On Linux, we can look for notify-send, which is pretty standard.
#
# - On macOS, we can look for terminal-notifier, which is just a nice
#   project I found that the user needs to (brew-)install themselves.
#
# - (And I dunno how useful this is, but at least it's something:)
#   If neither desktop notifier found, dump the message to a temporary
#   file. Not that non-developer users will know to look there (unless
#   we document it), but at least if anyone asks, we'll have something
#   to suggest which is easy to do.
#
#   - Note that on Linux, `mktemp` generally uses /tmp, but on macOS
#     you'll see a different path, e.g.,
#
#       @macOS $ mktemp
#       /var/folders/cs/h762zc8951zdm1ycc_2zqwb9l60wrb/T
#
#       @macOS $ echo $TMPDIR
#       /var/folders/cs/h762zc8951zdm1ycc_2zqwb9l60wrb/T/      
#
#     But there's still a /tmp directory nonetheless:
#
#       @macOS $ ll /tmp
#       /tmp -> private/tmp
#
#     And thankfully the `mktemp` command lets us use that path (which
#     simplifies troubleshooting, otherwise we would need to tell the
#     user to look under $TMPDIR; seems easier to just tell 'em /tmp):
#
#       @macOS $ mktemp /tmp/HELLO.XXXXXX
#       /tmp/HELLO.3vkABm

# FIXME/2021-02-21: The SensibleOpenMoveCursorAvoidSpecial plugin
# is not currently published... I'll get it there eventually....
# Not to worry, gvim-open-kindness will run fine without it.

# Adjust the Vim cursor before opening the file, if necessary, so
# the new buffer does not replace the quickfix buffer, an open help
# file, or the project tray, etc.
#
# Note that `man gvim` says --cmd is 'executed just before processing
# any vimrc', but that doesn't mean it runs before the file is loaded.
# Or even after, as far as I could tell (doesn't seem to run at all).
# So sending keystrokes to invoke command via --remote-send.
#
# Also, --remote-send fails if the server is not started, e.g.,
#   E247: no registered server named "SAMPI": Send failed.
# or if the command is not available (plugin not installed).
# In either case, this function absorbs the error and returns happy.
