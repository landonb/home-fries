# USAGE: Call to focus the Spotify application window,
#        useful for, e.g., window manager keybindings.

# Note: Spotify renames the window to "Artist - Song Title" so need to
#   do a little window ID math: get the process ID (PID) using a more
#   exact path, "spotify/spotify" (to distinguish from the associated
#   kdocker task). Then use wmctrl to get the window ID, and then to
#   focus it.

# FIXME/2020-01-07: Figure out how to tell kdocker to restore from tray.
# - For now, only works if Spotify is windowed, and not solely docked.
