-- ARGH: If a SELECT fails herein, SQLite won't even start.

-- 2016.01.25: We could disable libspatialite, which isn't loading outside
-- chroot and spews complaint jabber in the output stream, also spews jabber
-- when it's run, "-- Loading resources from /home/user/.sqliterc", so if
-- you run it from the command line, you always seem to have to deal with
-- blather. Your best bet is to postpend sqlite3 with "2> /dev/null"
