# 2016-04-26: I added rm_rotate because, while trashes were being
# created on different devices from rm_safe, rmtrash was only emptying
# the trash in the user's home.
#   Also: I find myself feeling more comfortable moving .trash to .trash-TBD
#   for a while and then deleting the .trash-TBD, just in case I don't, say,
#   in a week realize I deleted something. So here's a two-step trash:
#   if you call rmtrash once, it'll temporarily backup the .trash dirs;
#   when you call rmtrash again, it'll remove the last temporary backups.
#   In this manner, you can call rmtrash periodically, like once a month
#   or whatever, and you won't have to worry about accidentally deleting
#   things.
#   MAYBE: You could do an anacron check on the timestamp of the .trash-TBD
#          and call rm_rotate after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
